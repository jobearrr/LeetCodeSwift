## Requirements

* Xcode 15+
* Swift 5.9

## Running the solutions

Each solution has a test cases that can be found in the [SolutionsTests][solutions-tests-folder] folder.  
So it should have 100% code coverage for obvious reasons. ðŸ˜¬

You can modify the test cases, provide new inputs and expected outputs.

Or you can run the companion app `LeetSwift` (ðŸš§ under construction ðŸ‘·), to browse and run the test cases of the solutions for the problems you would like to check.

## Project structure
Here's the representation of the project structure, to make it easier to navigate through all the content.  

Please pay attention to this if adding problems and implementing solutions, so everything conforms to this folder structure.

## Problems

Below there is a table with all the problems with their corresponding solution.

You can find the walkthrough with detailed solution of all the problems on my blog [jobear.dev][jobear-blog-url], or concrete problem solution walkthrough on the `Walkthrough` column (ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸ‘·).

| # | Title | Solution | Difficulty | Topics | Time | Space | Walkthrough |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [Two Sum][001-problem] | [Solution][001-solution] | ![Difficulty][difficulty-easy-shield] | **`A`** **`HT`** | `O(n)` | `O(n)` | [Walkthrough][jobear-blog-url] |
| 2 | [Add Two Numbers][002-problem] | [Solution][002-solution] | ![Difficulty][difficulty-medium-shield] | **`LL`** **`M`** **`R`** | `O(max(m, n))` | `O(max(m, n))` | [Walkthrough][jobear-blog-url] |

### Topics
- **`A`** : Array
- **`HT`** : Hash Table
- **`LL`**: Linked List
- **`M`**: Math
- **`R`**: Recursion

## TDD Approach
Here, I use the TDD approach, writing the test cases before writing the solution. This way, I can quickly verify if the solution works as expected.

The goal is to always have enough test cases for all the problems and then work on the solution until all of these test cases are green.

If you would like to contribute, please use this same approach.
