## Requirements

* Xcode 15+
* Swift 5.9

## Running the solutions

Each problem solution has a test case in the [`Tests`][test-cases-folder-url] folder.

You can modify the test cases, provide new inputs and expected outputs.

Or you can run the companion app `LeetSwift`, to browse and run the test cases of the solutions for the problems you would like to check.

## Project structure
Here's the representation of the project structure, to make it easier to navigate through all folders.  

Please pay attention to this if adding problems and implementing solutions, so everything conforms to this folder structure.
``` bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ LeetSwift                                # Companion app

        â”œâ”€â”€ Core                             # Core testing support files
        â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ TestCaseProviding.swift      # Testing support
        â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ TestData.swift               # Definition of test data
        â””â”€â”€ Problems                         # Tests for the solutions of all problems
            â””â”€â”€ XXX - Problem title          # Problem solution test folder
                â””â”€â”€ ProblemTests.swift       # Run test cases for a solution to the corresponding problem
```

### Companion App (ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸ‘·)
The companion app `LeetSwift` is intended to make it easier to browse and run the solutions. You can run it on any platform.

### Problems

Below there is a table with all the problems with their corresponding solution.

You can find the walkthrough with detailed solution of all the problems on my blog [jobear.dev][jobear-blog-url], or concrete problem solution walkthrough on the `Walkthrough` column (ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸ‘·).

| # | Title | Solution | Difficulty | Topics | Time | Space | Walkthrough |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [Two Sum][001-problem] | [Solution][001-solution] | ![Difficulty][difficulty-easy-shield] | **`A`** **`HT`** | | | |

#### Topics
- **`A`** : Array
- **`HT`** : Hash Table

## Approach
Here, I use the TDD approach, writing the test cases before writing the solution. This way, I can quickly verify if the solution works as expected. The goals is to always have test cases for all the problems and to make all of them green.

If you would like to contribute, I recomment to write your solutions using this same approach.
